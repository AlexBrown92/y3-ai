Work for Advances in Aritificial Intelligence

Approaches in each version of "Genetic Algorithm":

* /Genetic Algorithm/... - Approach creating a lookup table only used for data set 1.
* /Genetic_Algorithm2/... - Approach creating rules to solve data sets 1 and 2.
* /Genetic_Algoirhtm3/... - Approach creating weights for a Neural Network to solve data set 3.
* /Genetic_Algorithm3b/... - Approach creating rules to solve data set 3.
